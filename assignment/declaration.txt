AI Usage Declaration

I used ChatGPT to help scaffold the static HTML/CSS project files and create a ready-to-run ZIP package to save time before I begin my recorded 1-hour coding session.

Files auto-generated:
- index.html
- styles.css
- README.md
- declaration.txt

During the actual recorded assessment (the 1-hour timed task), I will implement the Figma sections manually, live on camera, without relying on AI for the core HTML/CSS implementation. This recording will demonstrate my development process, decisions, and any troubleshooting steps.

If additional clarification is required, I will explain what was generated by AI vs what I implemented during the live assessment in the submission form.
